#lab-data-analysis

The repo provides guidance to the Experimental and Synthetic data analysis

##1. Data exploration
Plot your data and make superficial guesses about its behavior
Perform tests for normality and homogeneity of variances 
Run a distribution fitting

##2. Data normalization
Once you know the distribution, make a data transformation
Keep the transformation consistent within the same population/sample

##3. Hypothesis testing
Ensure your data satisfies assumptions
Choose your test
Make it done

##4. Modelling
If you need a model to describe or plan the next experiment, choose the best question

##5. Decision making
Report your results, mentioning:
assumptions for normality and heteroscedasticity check
normalization if done
test performed
power of the test
